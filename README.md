Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, servers, mobile devices, networks, and data from malicious attacks or unauthorized access. It plays a vital role in safeguarding sensitive information, ensuring privacy, and maintaining the integrity and availability of systems. With the increasing use of the internet and digital technologies, threats like hacking, phishing, malware, ransomware, and identity theft have become more common and sophisticated. Cybersecurity involves a combination of technologies, processes, and best practices, such as firewalls, antivirus software, encryption, multi-factor authentication, and regular updates. It applies to individuals, businesses, and governments alike. The goal is not only to prevent attacks but also to detect, respond to, and recover from any security breaches. As our world becomes more digitally connected, cybersecurity has become a critical field, requiring awareness, responsibility, and constant learning to stay one step ahead of cybercriminals and ensure digital safety.
